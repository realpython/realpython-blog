# Development and Deployment of Cookiecutter-Django via Docker

**Let's look at how to bootstrap a Django Project pre-loaded with the basic requirements needed in order to quickly get a project up and running.** Further, beyond the project structure, most bootstrapped projects also take care of setting up the development and production environment settings, without troubling the user much - so we'll look at that as well.

**Updates**:

- *10/04/2016*: Updated to the latest versions of cookiecutter (v[1.4.0](https://github.com/audreyr/cookiecutter/releases/tag/1.4.0)), cookiecutter-django, Django (v[1.10.1](https://docs.djangoproject.com/en/1.10/releases/1.10.1/)), Docker (v[1.12.1](https://github.com/docker/docker/releases/tag/v1.12.1)), Docker Compose (v[1.8.1](https://github.com/docker/compose/releases/tag/1.8.1)), and Docker Machine (v[0.8.2](https://github.com/docker/machine/releases/tag/v0.8.2)).

<br>

We'll be using the popular [cookiecutter-django](https://github.com/pydanny/cookiecutter-django) as the bootstrapper for our Django Project along with [Docker](https://www.docker.com/) to manage our application environment.

Let’s begin!

## Local Setup

Start by installing [cookiecutter](https://github.com/audreyr/cookiecutter) globally:

```sh
$ pip install cookiecutter==1.4.0
```

Now execute the following command to generate a bootstrapped django project:

```sh
$ cookiecutter https://github.com/pydanny/cookiecutter-django.git
```

This command runs cookiecutter with the [cookiecutter-django](https://github.com/pydanny/cookiecutter-django) repo, allowing us to enter project-specific details:

```sh

### Project Structure

Take a quick look at the generated project structure, taking specific note of the following directories:

1. "config" includes all the settings for our local and production environments.
1. "requirements" contains all the requirement files - *base.txt*, *local.txt*, *production.txt*, *test.txt* - which you can make changes to and then install via `pip install -r file_name`.
1. "django_cookiecutter_docker" is the main project directory which consists of the "static", "contrib" and "templates" directories along with the `users` app containing the models and boilerplate code associated with user authentication.

Some of the services may require environment variables. Rename the sample file *env.example* to *.env* and add the required variables.

## Docker Setup

Follow the instructions to install the [Docker Engine](https://docs.docker.com/engine/installation/) and the required Docker components - Engine, Machine, and Compose.

Check the versions:

```sh
$ docker --version
Docker version 1.12.1, build 6f9534c

$ docker-compose --version
docker-compose version 1.8.0, build f3628c7

$ docker-machine --version
docker-machine version 0.8.1, build 41b3b25
```

### Docker Machine

Once installed, create a new Docker host within the root of the newly created Django Project:

```sh
$ docker-machine create --driver virtualbox dev
$ eval $(docker-machine env dev)
```

> **NOTE**: `dev` can be named anything you want. For example, if you have more than one development environment, you could name them `djangodev1`, `djangodev2`, and so forth.

To view all Machines, run:

```sh
$ docker-machine ls
```

You can also view the IP of the `dev` Machine by running:

```sh
$ docker-machine ip dev
```

Finally, let's create a "/data" partition within the VM itself so that changes are persistent:

```sh
$ docker-machine ssh dev
$ sudo su
$ echo 'ln -sfn /mnt/sda1/data /data' >> /var/lib/boot2docker/bootlocal.sh
```

### Docker Compose

Now we can fire everything up - e.g., Django and Postgres - via Docker Compose:

```sh
$ docker-compose -f dev.yml build
$ docker-compose -f dev.yml up -d
```

> Running Windows? Hit this error - `Interactive mode is not yet supported on Windows`? See [this comment](https://realpython.com/blog/python/development-and-deployment-of-cookiecutter-django-via-docker/#comment-2442262433).

The first build will take a while. Due to [caching](https://docs.docker.com/engine/userguide/eng-image/dockerfile_best-practices/#/build-cache), subsequent builds will run much faster.

## Sanity Check

Now we can test our Django Project by applying the migrations and then running the server:

```sh
$ docker-compose -f dev.yml run django python manage.py makemigrations
$ docker-compose -f dev.yml run django python manage.py migrate
$ docker-compose -f dev.yml run django python manage.py createsuperuser
```

Navigate to the `dev` IP (port 8000) in your browser to view the Project quick start page with debugging mode on and many more development environment oriented features installed and running.

Stop the containers (`docker-compose stop`), initialize a new git repo, commit, and PUSH to GitHub.

## Deployment Setup

So, we have successfully set up our Django Project locally using cookiecutter-django and served it up using the traditional *manage.py* command line utility via Docker.

In this section, we move on to the deployment part, where the role of a web server comes into play. We will be setting up a Docker Machine on a [Digital Ocean](https://www.digitalocean.com/?refcode=d8f211a4b4c2) droplet, with Postgres as our database and [Nginx](http://nginx.org/) as our web server.

Along with this, we will be making use of [gunicorn](http://gunicorn.org/) instead of Django’s single-threaded development server to run the server process.

### Why Nginx?

Apart from being a high-performance HTTP server, which almost every good web server out in the market is, Nginx has some really good features that make it stand out from the rest - namely that it:

- Can couple as a [reverse proxy server](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Reverse_proxy).
- Can host more than one site.
- Has an asynchronous way of handling web requests, which means that since it doesn’t rely on threads to handle web requests, it has a higher performance while handling multiple requests.

### Why Gunicorn?

[Gunicorn](http://gunicorn.org/) is a Python WSGI HTTP server that can be easily customized and provides better performance in terms of reliability than Django's single-threaded development server within production environments.

### Digital Ocean Setup

We will be using a [Digital Ocean](https://www.digitalocean.com/?refcode=d8f211a4b4c2) server for this tutorial. After you [sign up](https://www.digitalocean.com/?refcode=d8f211a4b4c2) (if necessary), [generate](https://www.digitalocean.com/community/tutorials/how-to-use-the-digitalocean-api-v2) a Personal Access Token, and then run the following command:

```sh
$ docker-machine create \
-d digitalocean \
--digitalocean-access-token=ADD_YOUR_TOKEN_HERE \
prod
```

This should only take few minutes to provision the Digital Ocean droplet and set up a new Docker Machine called `prod`. While you wait, navigate to the [Digital Ocean Control Panel](https://cloud.digitalocean.com); you should see a new droplet being created, again, called `prod`.

Once done, there should now be two machines running, one locally (`dev`) and one on Digital Ocean (`prod`). Run `docker-machine ls` to confirm:

```sh
NAME   ACTIVE   DRIVER         STATE     URL                         SWARM   DOCKER    ERRORS
dev    *        virtualbox     Running   tcp://192.168.99.100:2376           v1.12.1
prod   -        digitalocean   Running   tcp://104.131.50.131:2376           v1.12.1
```

Set `prod` as the active machine and then load the Docker environment into the shell:

```sh
$ eval $(docker-machine env prod)
```

### Docker Compose (take 2)

Within *.env* update the `DJANGO_ALLOWED_HOSTS` variable to match the Digital Ocean IP address - i.e., `DJANGO_ALLOWED_HOSTS=159.203.77.132`.

Now we can create the build and then fire up the services in the cloud:

```sh
$ docker-compose build
$ docker-compose up -d
```

### Sanity Check (take 2)

Apply all the migrations:

```sh
$ docker-compose -f production.yml run --rm django python manage.py makemigrations
$ docker-compose -f production.yml run --rm django python manage.py migrate
```

That's it!

Now just visit your server's IP address, associated with the Digital Ocean droplet, and view it in the browser.

You should be good to go.
